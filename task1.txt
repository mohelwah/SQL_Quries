SQL Query
1.create a table with all ‘subid’ where the ‘country_code’ is mismatching with the ‘conversion_IP’
2.create a table where the same ‘conversion_IP’ can be found 2 or more times in different ‘subids’;
and a column with the corresponding ‘adv_payout_usd’
3. Considering all the events that happened in the ‘country_code’: US, what is the % of mismatch found? (mismatch
is defined as a mismatch between ‘country_code’ and country derived from ‘conversion_IP’)
4. A query to calculate  % of ‘adv_payout_usd’ for each ‘application_id’ where mismatch has been found
